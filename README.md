## Alkacon Software develops a Google Web Toolkit wrapper for the Vienna IKS Editables (VIE)

OpenCms from Alkacon Software is a professional content management system that helps content managers worldwide to create and maintain websites fast and efficiently.

Interactive Knowledge Stack ([IKS](http://www.iks-project.eu/)) is an EU funded project bringing semantic technologies (capabilities) to content management systems. Alkacon Software is an industrial partner in the IKS project.

IKS now provides the Vienna IKS Editables (VIE), a JavaScript library for implementing semantic interaction in web applications decoupled from the underlying content management system. IKS also provides Apache Stanbol, a reusable set of software components that are meant to be accessed over RESTful interfaces to provide semantic services for content management. Both the VIE and Stanbol components have been developed as part of the IKS project over the last 2 years and are now close a release version.


## By adopting the IKS software stack, Alkacon plans to achieve the following goals for OpenCms:

1. Allow the generation of semantically annotated content for search engine optimization (SEO).
2. Enhance the advanced direct edit mode of OpenCms with inline-editing capabilities using VIE.
3. Support for semantic content enrichment, using VIE as frontend and Stanbol as backend.



## What is VIE-RELATED?

<b>VIE-RELATED</b> is a sandbox project to test, evaluate and prove client software components provided by the IKS software stack.

#### Motivation

Having a playground to evaluate possible technologies that can potentially integrated into a future version of OpenCms.

#### Benefit

Hosting a project that serves as test environment on github makes it easier to develop and to share results with external parties.
