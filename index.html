				<p>Steven Paul Jobs was an American businessman and inventor widely
					recognized as a charismatic pioneer of the personal computer
					revolution. He was co-founder, chairman, and chief executive
					officer of Apple Inc. Jobs was co-founder and previously served as
					chief executive of Pixar Animation Studios; he became a member of the
					board of directors of The Walt Disney Company in 2006, following the
					acquisition of Pixar by Disney.</p>
				<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. The House has passed a short-term spending bill that keeps the government running for six weeks and buys time for future budget negotiations. The 352-66 vote sends the measure to President Barack Obama in time to avert a government shutdown at midnight. The legislation gives Congress and the White House more time to iron out their differences on a pile of unfinished budget work totaling more than $1 trillion. It also ends a fight over whether some aid for victims of Hurricane Irene and other natural disasters should have been offset by cuts elsewhere.</p>
				<p>CUPERTINO, California It's the first time in years that Apple has unveiled a major new product without Steve Jobs presiding over the announcement. The company's new CEO, Tim Cook, was the one introducing the company's new iPhone today -- faster and more powerful than the previous version. Cook took over as CEO after Jobs, who has been battling health problems, resigned in August.</p>
