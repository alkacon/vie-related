Alkacon Software is an industrial partner in the IKS project.\r\n\r\nIKS now provides the Vienna IKS Editables (VIE), a JavaScript library for implementing semantic interaction in web applications decoupled from the underlying content management system. IKS also provides Apache Stanbol, a reusable set of software components that are meant to be accessed over RESTful interfaces to provide semantic services for content management. Both the VIE and Stanbol components have been developed as part of the IKS project over the last 2 years and are now close a release version.\r\n\r\n\r\n## By adopting the IKS software stack, Alkacon plans to achieve the following goals for OpenCms:\r\n\r\n1. Allow the generation of semantically annotated content for search engine optimization (SEO).\r\n2. Enhance the advanced direct edit mode of OpenCms with inline-editing capabilities using VIE.\r\n3. Support for semantic content enrichment, using VIE as frontend and Stanbol as backend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is VIE-RELATED?\r\n\r\n<b>VIE-RELATED</b> is a sandbox project to test, evaluate and prove client software components provided by the IKS software stack.\r\n\r\n#### Motivation\r\n\r\nHaving a playground to evaluate possible technologies that can potentially integrated into a future version of OpenCms.\r\n\r\n#### Benefit\r\n\r\nHosting a project that serves as test environment on github makes it easier to develop and to share results with external parties.\r\n\r\n#### Current features\r\n\r\n- Getting google flickr images that are related to the written text by only one click and its integration into TinyMCE\r\n\r\n#### Upcoming features\r\n\r\n- Getting related content that is stored in OpenCms by only one click and its integration into TinyMCE\r\n- SEO by using schema.org annotated content for delivered web pages\r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nDownload the projects ZIP-File and open the index.html in the root directory\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related links\r\n\r\n- [acacia project on GitHub](https://github.com/alkacon/acacia)\r\n- [VIE-GWT project on GitHub](https://github.com/alkacon/vie-gwt)\r\n- [VIE project website](http://viejs.org/)\r\n- [Apache Stanbol project website](http://incubator.apache.org/stanbol/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contact: Alkacon Software GmbH - The OpenCms Experts\r\n\r\n<b>Please use our [contact form](http://www.alkacon.com/en/company/contact/form.html) to contact us directly.</b>\r\n\r\nDo not send us an email for the first contact, since we have problems with serious amounts of spam.\r\n\r\n<b>Our office address:</b>  \r\nAlkacon Software GmbH - The OpenCms Experts  \r\nAn der Wachsfabrik 13   \r\nDE-50996 Cologne, Germany\r\n\r\n- [http://www.alkacon.com/](http://www.alkacon.com/)\r\n- [sales@alkacon.com](mailto:sales@alkacon.com)\r\n- [Directions to the office](http://www.alkacon.com/en/company/contact/directions.html)\r\n- [Map of the office location](http://www.alkacon.com/en/company/contact/map.html)\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**Please note**: This readme file was written to the best of knowledge.
