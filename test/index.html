		<p>Steven Paul Jobs was an American businessman and inventor
			widely recognized as a charismatic pioneer of the personal computer
			revolution. He was co-founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
			of Apple Inc. Jobs was co-founder and previously served as chief
			executive of Pixar Animation Studios; he became a member of the board
			of directors of The Walt Disney Company in 2006, following the
			acquisition of Pixar by Disney.</p>
		<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. The House has passed a short-term spending
			bill that keeps the government running for six weeks and buys time
			for future budget negotiations. The 352-66 vote sends the measure to
			President Barack Obama in time to avert a government shutdown at
			midnight. The legislation gives Congress and the White House more
			time to iron out their differences on a pile of unfinished budget
			work totaling more than $1 trillion. It also ends a fight over
			whether some aid for victims of Hurricane Irene and other natural
			disasters should have been offset by cuts elsewhere.</p>
		<p>CUPERTINO, California It's the first time in years that Apple
			has unveiled a major new product without Steve Jobs presiding over
			the announcement. The company's new CEO, Tim Cook, was the one
			introducing the company's new iPhone today -- faster and more
			powerful than the previous version. Cook took over as CEO after Jobs,
			who has been battling health problems, resigned in August.</p>
